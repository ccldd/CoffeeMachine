* No timezone was specified. I assumed that the timezone for any date and time related operations is UTC.
* I didn't use https://openweatherapi.com/ as it requires a sign up.
* The weather api requires a location. To keep it it simple, I hardcoded a latitude and longitude for the location.
* Requirement 3 takes precedence over requirement 2 as if it is not brewing coffee today, then the coffee machine cannot be out of coffee.
